Revision history for Perl extension XML::SAX::PurePerl.

0,80  Fri Nov 2  2001
    - Major updates - tested against 119 files in the oasis
      xmlconformance test suite. Passes all but 1 on 5.7.2,
      and passes most on lower perls. Version reflects
      the amount of changes done.
    - However, it does not get all the events perfect yet.
      Most document events will be right, but DTD events
      are not complete yet.
    - Many bugs fixed in the process of the above. Should
      parse just about any document you can throw at it
      now.
