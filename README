XML::SAX::PurePerl
==================

This is a Pure Perl XML parser, making use of PerlIO for supporting multiple
encodings (requires Perl 5.7.2 or higher), hand-written LL parsing, and a
PerlSAX2 interface, as discussed in depth on the Perl-XML mailing list.

It is far from "complete", but progressing rapidly, and is capable of parsing
most XML that doesn't contain an internal subset or make use of external
entities. These features are being worked on right now.
